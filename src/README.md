** This branch is an automated script for the login page
* It contains 7 tests including: Validating successful login, invalid email,
* Invalid password, help sign in, help sign in with invalid credentials, login
* with org landing page validation, and remember me check box.

** It was challenging finding a way to safley encrypt credentials.


* My steps:

1. Create Maven Project in intellij
2. Grab ChromeDriver
3. Auto manage chrome driver
4. Setup necessary dependencies
5. Created tests
6. Test code
7. Push code


** If I had more time to work on this project I would improve it in the following ways:
